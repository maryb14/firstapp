# First app
This is my first attempt to building an application. It is going to be a language game. Not just for fun, but also for learning.
#####What programming languages will I use?
HTML, CSS, Javascript and Rails.
#####Why a language learning game?
Because I'm passionate about them and I find appropriately to implement a game used for learning.
