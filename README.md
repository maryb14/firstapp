# First app
This is my first attempt to building an application. It is going to be written while being mentored by Dominika Mips and part of the program Learn IT, Girl! Thank you all for the help!
#####What is it actually?
A language game.
#####What is it called?
Langy Learny (kind of from language learning)
#####How it will look?
It is going to have a home page and then several sections for specific topics of vocabulary or grammar. Each topic will be illustrated with images or sentences and will comprise theory. In addition, we will have some tests for the user to check his/hers new learned words.
#####What programming languages will I use?
Javascript and Ruby on Rails. And I will also write some HTML and CSS.
#####Why a language learning game?
Because I'm passionate about languages and I find it great to combine these two interests of mine: learning foreign languages and coding. I hope that for the beginning it is a good choice.
