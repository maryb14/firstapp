		Well, there’s something I learnt last Sunday, on 16th November where the second tour of presidential elections in Romania took place. What I learned? That people matter. A lot.
These elections have offered a huge surprise to all the Romanians: on one hand, we selected a President which is part of the German minority in my country; on the other hand, the percentage of people who went to vote was one of the highest in the last 25 years of Romanian democracy.
I won’t speak too much about the man we chose. Time will prove his quality and if he’s able to live up to the expectations he created. However, it is important the function his opponent was and still is in. He is the prime minister of Romania. His person is not at all important for what I want to say here, that is that Romanians votes mostly for the change. Not for the people besides those campaigns, but for the hope of a better future. And Victor Ponta, Klaus Johanis (the elected President of Romania)’s opponent, was the image of the people we blame for all the flaws the Romanian democracy might have and for all the hardships we endure every day, the politicians. I’m not sure if they are to blame, I can’t say until now, but I certainly can say that I was happy that Romanians took action on the day of the elections.
That leads me to the second aspect I want to point out, the fact that 64.10% of Romanians went and voted on the 16th of November. That left me grateful for their behavior (I don’t have the age to vote yet).
