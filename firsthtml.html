		 I am not sure if coding is necessary. Probably not. We are essentially different and so I do not think everyone can or should have a job which is based on their coding, but there is a part of coding which should definitely known by everyone. I am speaking about that part of coding, or programming for that matter which is about imagination and teamwork. You think programming means just sitting in front of a computer with no talk to anyone else? Sorry to say it so frankly, but you are wrong. Programming means having ideas. And this is a huge proportion of the whole subject. The whole point behind coding is to make things look good, behave well and be at optimized as possible. This process means you have to rack your brain for finding the solution. You may say, but imagination is art and programming does not seem art. You are partly right. The imagination we use in programming is very much different from the one we make use of when we create art. Creating art we explore a new whole world and we are able to make everything, but everything that crosses our minds. With computers, on the other hand, we can do just a few things. They are indeed lots of them. But there are some limits. For instance, you can not make a square bigger than the screen and still see it. In artistic creation you can. In other words, in programming you have a few resources of which you need to make use as good as possible. That is the difference. In art we create new worlds, in computers we do the best we can of the worlds we created. And thinking about life, do not we also have to do the best we can of our talents and time?
